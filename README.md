# Learning Hub

This repository is a personal learning hub for organizing and sharing study notes across mathematics and artificial intelligence.

The primary goal of this project is **learning through structured documentation**:
- to help myself build a long-term, searchable knowledge base
- to provide reference-style learning resources for others with similar interests

This is **not** a polished textbook, course replacement, or authoritative reference.
Most contents are learning notes written during study, and may be incomplete, evolving, or revised over time.

## Scope

Current topics include:

### Mathematics
- Abstract Algebra
- Real Analysis
- Complex Analysis
- Probability (early stage)

### Artificial Intelligence
- Reinforcement Learning (theory-focused at the moment)
- Other AI-related topics may be added gradually

Each topic is organized independently, with its own structure and navigation.

## Repository Structure
```text
learning-hub/
├─ math/          # Mathematics notes
├─ ai/            # Artificial intelligence notes
├─ templates/     # Note templates used across the repo
├─ assets/        # Shared images and diagrams
├─ RULES.md       # Naming and formatting conventions
├─ ROADMAP.md     # Learning progress and future plans
├─ LICENSE        # License for text and code in this repository
└─ README.md      # Project overview
```
    

Each major directory contains its own `README.md` explaining:
- covered topics
- recommended reading order
- current completion status

## How to Use This Repository

If you are a **reader**:
- Start from the `math/` or `ai/` directory
- Follow the README files as entry points
- Treat the notes as *study companions*, not finished materials

If you are also **learning the same subjects**:
- You may find it helpful to compare explanations, summaries, or conceptual breakdowns
- Feel free to adapt ideas, structures, or templates for your own notes

## Notes on Quality and Style

- Notes prioritize **clarity and understanding** over formal completeness
- Proofs may be sketched or partially informal
- Drafts and exploratory content are kept when useful for learning
- Some sections may be reorganized or rewritten as understanding improves

Errors and omissions are possible.
